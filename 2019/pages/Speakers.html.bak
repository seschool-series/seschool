                Understanding the Behavior of Android apps by Means of Static
                and Dynamic Analyses <br />
                <strong>Abstract</strong> Software engineering researchers
                suddenly have access to a huge software ecosystem that can be
                analyzed: Millions of mobile apps on public stores such as the
                Google Play. How can we analyze such a large amount of
                information and get something meaningful out of it? This course
                will give an overview of the most useful static and dynamic
                analysis techniques for Android apps. Such techniques will help
                you understand the behavior of an app, and identify, for
                instance, whether an app may hide some malicious behavior, or
                whether it fails under specific circumstances. The course will
                also include hands-on material.<br />

                Master's degrees in computer science from the University of
                Milano-Bicocca in Italy. She completed her Ph.D. in informatics
                at the Universita' della Svizzera Italiana in Lugano,
                Switzerland in 2011. In her Ph.D. thesis she defined and
                developed the notion of Automatic Workarounds, a self-healing
                technique to recover Web applications from field failures, a
                work for which she received the Fritz Kutter Award for the best
                industry related Ph.D. thesis in computer science in
                Switzerland. Before joining IMDEA Software Institute in December
                2014 as Assistant Research Professor, she has been a
                postdoctoral researcher in the software engineering group at
                Saarland University in Germany. During her postdoc, she has also
                been a visiting researcher at Google in Mountain View.
                Alessandra's research interests are in software engineering, and
                in particular on testing and analysis techniques to improve the

                Protecting Android Apps: Methodologies and Opportunities <br />
                <b>Abstract</b>  This 3-hours tutorial introduces automated
                methods to help developers better protect their Android
                applications against attacks. First, this tutorial presents
                methods that can automatically detect and repair vulnerabilities
                by leveraging specially-crafted templates and mining software
                repositories. The second part of the tutorial introduces methods
                that can automatically infer permissions for Android apps. Apps
                often declare more permissions than those that are needed, and
                malware can leverage these unnecessary permissions to perform
                malicious actions. The last part describes the line of work of
                sandbox mining where application behaviours are confined to
                behaviours observed during automatic testing. Most of this
                tutorial would be lecture based, but a hands-on session would be
                included for the second part.<br />

                <br />
                <strong>Abstract</strong>  We have seen tremendous growth in the
                use of mobile devices over the last few years. This has fueled
                the development of millions of software applications for these
                mobile devices often called as ‘apps’. Current estimates
                indicate that there are hundreds of thousands of mobile app
                developers. As a result, in recent years, there has been a
                increasing amount of software engineering research being
                conducted on mobile apps to help such mobile app developers. In
                this first half of the day, I will discuss current and future
                trends within the framework of the various stages in the
                software development life cycle. I will first present the recent
                advances done in requirements, design, development, testing,
                maintenance, and release engineering stages of mobile apps. Then
                on the second half of the day, I will present the challenges
                present in current work, followed by the future opportunities
                and the risks present in pursing such research. <br />

                Platform Development for Mobile Devices with Xamarin.Forms<br />
                <strong>Abstract</strong> To ensure a wide-spread use, companies
                often want to provide their app on as many platforms as
                possible. Unfortunately, developing and maintaining an app on
                many platforms can be very costly: one has to design, program,
                and maintain each app separately. Moreover, programmers often
                specialize on a specific platform so that often more programmers
                are needed to cover more platforms. The aim of Xamarin is to
                tackle this problem: the idea of Xamarin.Forms is to provide a
                platform where .NET programmers can write apps in C# and the
                final app is then ported to Android, iOS, Mac, UWP, and WPF.
                With such a platform the developer is able to write code once
                and run it almost everywhere. In this tutorial, we will create a
                small sample app running on each of the above listed devices and
                see how to use some platform dependent features. </td>

                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract </span>In recent
                years, software development and release planning activities
                shifted from a traditional paradigm, in which a software system
                is periodically released following a road map, towards a
                paradigm in which continuous releases become available for
                upgrade with a cadence of few weeks, if not days. The
                distribution of updates through app online stores (e.g., Google
                Play) is accompanied by a mechanism that allows users to rate
                releases using scores (i.e., star ratings) and text reviews. The
                way an app is rated can tremeudously affect the commercial
                success of an app and, for this reason, developers are somehow
                enforced to deliver high quality apps to users. <br />
                This three-hours tutorial will introduce mining software
                repository-based automated methods to support developers when
                (i) monitoring the users' reactions so that they can take
                informed decisions on how to improve the quality of their apps
                and (ii) detecting portions of source code more likely to
                contain issues (e.g., performance-related problems) that might
                negatively affect end-user rates. Most of this tutorial will be
                lecture-based, but a hands-on session will be included for the
                second part. <br />

                University of Zurich, Switzerland. He received the European PhD
                degree in Management &amp; Information Technology from the
                University of Salerno, Italy, in 2017. His research interests
                include software maintenance and evolution, empirical software
                engineering, source code quality, change and defect prediction,
                green mining and mining software repositories. On these topics,
                he has published 45+ papers appeared in international software
                engineering conferences and journals. <br />
                He was also the recipient of two ACM/SIGSOFT and one IEEE/TCSE
                Distinguished Paper Awards at ASE'13, ICSE'15, and ICSME'17,
                respectively. He serves and has served as a program committee
                member of various international conferences (e.g., MSR, ICPC,
                ICSME), and as referee for various international journals (e.g.,
                TSE, TOSEM, JSS) in the fields of software engineering. Since
                2016 he is Review Board Member for EMSE, and he was the
                recipient of a Distinguished Reviewer Award for his reviewing
                activities conducted for the journal in 2017. <br />
                He co-organized the 2nd International Workshop on Machine
                Learning Techniques for Software Quality Evaluation (MaLTeSQuE
                2018), and he is currently organizing the International Workshop
                on Architecture-Based Continuity in DevOps (ABCD 2018). He is
                also Guest Editor of special issues related to his research
                interests that will appear in EMSE and JSEP.<br />
