TDD is central                technical practice that enforces writing tests before production                code in an incremental manner, providing the developer with a                safety net for implementing new functionality and refactoring                code. It makes developers directly responsible for the quality                of the code that they write. By the end of the workshop,                students will be able to write unit tests using Java and Junit                following a small set of principles, express requirements and                design decisions in the form of tests, and develop testable code                by applying TDD. Students will practice theory by applying the                material covered in the context of small examples, both                individually and as a group. <br />                <br />                Prerequisites: <br />                (1) intermediate knowledge of Java; <br />                (2) familiarity with object-oriented programming; <br />                (3) basic knowledge of git. <br />                <br />                Level: all levels <br />                <br />                Notes to self:<br />                ● Inquire about using web-cat automated grading for this course                - get permission<br />                ● Individual exercises: Social Network example<br />                ● Group exercise: BSK using Randori style <br />                <br />              </td>            </tr>            <tr>              <td style="border-color:white; text-align:left"> <b>Speaker's Bio</b><br />                Hakan Erdogmus is an Associate Teaching Professor at Carnegie                Mellon University’s Department of Electrical and Computer                Engineering. He joined CMU’s Silicon Valley campus in 2013 and                is one of the founding faculty of ECE’s Master of Science in                Software Engineering program. His research and teaching focus on                software quality, testing, modern development practices,                software process, measurement, empirical studies, and software                engineering economics. He published and lectured extensively on                these topics. Hakan is a past Editor in Chief of IEEE Software                and co-editor of two Springer volumes on software engineering.                He has a PhD in Telecommunications from University of Quebec and                an MS in Computer Science from McGill University, Canada. He is                a recipient of Eugene L. Grant Award in Engineering Economics                awarded by the American Society for Engineering Education. </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table>        <br />        <br />        <center>          <table id="invisible" style="width:730px; text-align:center">          </table>        </center>      </div>    </div>    <p style="text-align:center; font-size:9px">SEschool@unibz</p>    <p style="text-align:center; font-size:9px">Updated By Aiman, Claudio,      Martin</p>  </body></html>
